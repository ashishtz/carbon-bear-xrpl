					The Carbon Reduction App is a revolutionary platform designed to
					empower individuals and businesses in their efforts to reduce carbon
					emissions and contribute to a greener future. By leveraging
					cutting-edge technology, including blockchain and cryptocurrency, our
					app aims to create a transparent and efficient marketplace for carbon
					reduction initiatives. Here's how it works:
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className="mt-5">
				<h2 className="mb-2 text-h3">User Role:</h2>
				<p className="text-lg">
					As an end user or common person, you can actively participate in
					carbon reduction by purchasing products that are designed to minimise
					carbon emissions. Once you make a qualifying purchase, you can verify
					it within the app. Upon verification, the app will reward you with
					carbon tokens called BEAR (Carbon Emission Avoidance Reward). BEAR
					tokens function similarly to cryptocurrencies, representing your
					carbon reduction efforts
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className="mt-5">
				<h2 className="mb-2 text-h3">Token Exchange:</h2>
				<p className="text-lg">
					With BEAR tokens in hand, you have the option to exchange them for XRP
					currency, a widely recognised cryptocurrency. The XRP currency can
					later be converted into Fiat currency, providing you with a tangible
					incentive for your eco-friendly actions. This integration of
					blockchain technology ensures secure and transparent transactions,
					protecting the value of your earned BEAR tokens.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className="mt-5">
				<h2 className="mb-2 text-h3">Company Role:</h2>
				<p className="text-lg">
					Companies that produce carbon emissions as part of their operations,
					such as restaurants or mills, can also participate in our app. These
					businesses can visit the platform to purchase BEAR tokens, which are
					available for sale. By acquiring BEAR tokens, companies can offset
					their carbon footprint and demonstrate their commitment to
					sustainability. In exchange for BEAR tokens, companies can make use of
					the app's token exchange feature to acquire XRP tokens.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div className="mt-5">
				<p className="text-lg">
					By embracing the power of blockchain technology and individual
					actions, the Carbon Bear App aims to create a sustainable and
					incentivized ecosystem where both individuals and businesses can play
					an integral role in reducing carbon emissions.
